This buildroot has been configured to make PowerTune Dash. This is a work in progress and I am not the Author. Links to Author will be provided. 
Enviroment used is Ubuntu 20.04
I have not been able to get 100% of my RPI3 to work. Such as Wifi. I dont really understand why. So feedback is greatly appreciated so that I can continue this. 
I am not a savy programmer and know only small amounts about Linux so please keep that in mind. 

Credit goes to https://github.com/MarkusIppy/buildroot.git and https://github.com/BastianGschrey/PowerTune for there work. 

First step after cloning is opening target dir in terminal and running 
make raspberrypi3_qt5we_defconfig
wait for this to complete and then run
make menuconfig
Wait for the menu to appear
Use Right arrow key and navigate toe Load on the bottom and hit enter
the File path will be correct but we need to change the name of the file to PowerTune.config and then hit enter
After this we need to go to Save and save this again but file name needs to be .config. Path is the same 
Once this is done we need to navigate to Target Packages, Graphic Libraries and applications And Scroll the fine package named Powertune. There is a asterisk next to is just hit
space bar to deselct this. This is just for now. We will reselect later. 
After this is done use right arrow to go to save and save this. Then we can exit back to terminal and invoke make
This step will take a few hours.
